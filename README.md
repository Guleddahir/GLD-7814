### 💡 Core Areas of Expertise

I apply my skills across various critical domains, from river flow simulation to data-driven forecasting:

* **Flood Risk Assessment:** Conducting 1D/2D hydraulic modeling (**HEC-RAS**) to map floodplains, assess infrastructure impacts, and design mitigation strategies.
    > *Focus Area:* Riverine hydraulics, bridge scour analysis, floodplain management.
* **Watershed Analysis:** Developing rainfall-runoff models (**HEC-HMS**) for basin characterization, simulating hydrographs, and designing detention/retention facilities.
    > *Focus Area:* Curve Number method, Green-Ampt infiltration, reservoir routing.
* **Data Visualization & Reporting:** Creating dynamic and interactive dashboards (**Tableau/Power BI**) to communicate complex model results and environmental data trends to stakeholders.
* **Environmental Data Science:** Using **Python** and **R** for time-series analysis of flow, precipitation, and water quality data.
