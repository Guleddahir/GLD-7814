I am a Water Resources and Irrigation Engineer skilled in GIS, spatial data analysis, HEC-RAS, HEC-HMS, SQL, Python, and R. I build data-driven models, geospatial workflows, and hydraulic tools that support watershed assessment, flood analysis, irrigation planning, and sustainable water management.
